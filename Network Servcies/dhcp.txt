Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 

a protocol used to assign IP addresses and other configuration settings (like subnet masks, default gateways and DNS servers) to devices dynamically without manual intervention.

DHCP prevents needing to manually assign iP addresses to every single device - this would be extremely time-consuming to manage and very error prone. DHCP automates this process by ensuring every device gets a unique IP address and other network settings seamlessly.

DHCP server lifecycle:
    1. Discovery
        A client/device joins the network and broadcasts a HDCP Discover message to find an available to find an available DHCP server

        The message is sent as a broadcast because the client doesn't yet have an IP address. 

    2. Offer
        The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Offer, proposing an IP address and additional configuration details (subnet mask, gateway, DNS)

    3. Request
        The client responds with a DHCP Request, indicating it accepts the Offer
    
    4. Acknowledgment
        The server sends a DHCP Acknowledgment, finalizing the lease. The client now has an assigned IP address for a specified lease duration.

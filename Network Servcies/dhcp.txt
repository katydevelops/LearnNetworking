Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 

a protocol used to assign IP addresses and other configuration settings (like subnet masks, default gateways and DNS servers) to devices dynamically without manual intervention.

DHCP prevents needing to manually assign iP addresses to every single device - this would be extremely time-consuming to manage and very error prone. DHCP automates this process by ensuring every device gets a unique IP address and other network settings seamlessly.

DHCP enables Dynamic IP recycling - ISPs (Internet Service Providers) assign dynamic public IPs to devices temporarily using DHCP. When the lease expires (e.g., after a few hours or months), that IP is returned to the pool and reused for another device.
This ensures that IPs arenâ€™t "wasted" on devices not currently active on the network.

DHCP server lifecycle:
    1. Discovery
        A client/device joins the network and broadcasts a HDCP Discover message to find an available to find an available DHCP server

        The message is sent as a broadcast because the client doesn't yet have an IP address. 

    2. Offer
        The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Offer, proposing an IP address and additional configuration details (subnet mask, gateway, DNS)

    3. Request
        The client responds with a DHCP Request, indicating it accepts the Offer
    
    4. Acknowledgment
        The server sends a DHCP Acknowledgment, finalizing the lease. The client now has an assigned IP address for a specified lease duration.
            A "lease" is the time period for which and IP address is assigned to a device - when the lease expires - the device must request a renewal (if it's still active) or if the device is no longer on the network, the IP address returns to the pool for reuse

    Benefits of DHCP
        1. Automated IP Management
            - no need for manual configuration of every device

        2. Consistency 
            - ensures devices receive the correct configuration
        
        3. Flexibility 
            - devices can join and leave the network without requiring admin intervention

        4. Scalability
            - works seamlessly for small office networks or large enterprise environments

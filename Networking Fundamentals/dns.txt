DNS

Domain Name System - the internet's phone book :) translates the domain name into IP addresses

Why is DNS important?
    - stores IP address needed for for web traffic
    - allowing employees to access internal resources like an intranet
    - supporting application functionality (i.e. database, web servers)

How DNS works:
    1. DNS Query is sent
        - computer asks the DNS Resolver (usually your ISP or configured DNS server) for the IP address of the domain name
    
    2. Cache Lookup
        - first the resolver checks its cache to see if it already knows the answer, if not, it continues the process
    
    3. Root Server Lookup
        - the resolver queries one of the Root DNS Servers, which directs the query to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) DNS Server
    
    4. TLD Server Lookup
        - the TLD server points the resolver to the Authoritative DNS Server for the domain.

    5. Authoritative Server Lookup
        - the authoritative server provides the final answer - the IP address of the domain

    6. Response is Sent Back
        - the resolver returns the IP address to your computer, which can now connect to the destination server

DNS Resolver: The first stop for DNS queries (usually provided by your ISP or Googleâ€™s DNS at 8.8.8.8).
Root DNS Servers: The top-level directory for the internet, redirecting queries to TLD servers.
TLD DNS Servers: Handle domains like .com, .org, .net, or country-specific TLDs like .uk.
Authoritative DNS Server: Stores the actual records for a domain (e.g., example.com).
